Step 1: Import libraries

!pip install matplotlib==3.1.3

!pip install osmnet

!pip install folium

!pip install rtree

!pip install pygeos

!pip install geojson

!pip install geopandas

Step 2: clone data from https://github.com/CityScope/CSL_HCMC

Step 3: Load district boundaries and district population from: Data\GIS\Population\population_HCMC\population_shapefile\Population_District_Level.shp

Step 4: Load user click data

Step 5:query the 5 districts with the fastest population density growth rate (Data 2019  v√† 2017)

Step 6: Use spatial join (from geopandas.tools import sjoin) to query the user's click points in the 5 hottest districts

Step 7: use KMean for 5 hottest in step 6 with K = 20

Step 8: Save 01 cluster of points with the most points in the districts in Step 5.

Step 9: Show the map of the largest clusters by district in the form of HEATMAP

Step 10: Save heatmap format file.png
