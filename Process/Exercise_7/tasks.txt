Using Wine dataset, combined with streamlit:

- Added option PCA, allowing to enter the number of dimensions after reduction.

- Input feature X after dimensionality reduction will turn into X'. Use X' for training and prediction.

Note: The dimensional reduction model is performed on the train set, then the parameters will be kept to be applied on the test set, not refitted on the test set.
