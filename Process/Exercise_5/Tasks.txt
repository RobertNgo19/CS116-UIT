Linear regression exercise uses 2 methods of Train/Test split and K-fold cross validation to evaluate the model.

Use Streamlit to make the application interface

Design interfaces with Streamlit to be able to:
- Upload csv file (later can be replaced with another dataset easily).
- Display data table with uploaded file
- Select input feature (input data columns)
- Select coefficient for train/test split: For example 0.8 means 80% to train and 20% to test
- Select K coefficient for K-fold cross validation: Example K = 4
- "Run" button to run and evaluate the algorithm

Output sẽ là biểu đồ cột hiển thị các kết quả sử dụng độ đo MAE và MSE. 

Note: Train/Test split and K-Fold cross validation are performed independently, choose only one of these two methods.
