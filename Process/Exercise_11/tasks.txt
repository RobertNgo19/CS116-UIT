With the default parameters of a model, usually we will not achieve the highest accuracy.

To choose the best model, we will find the most efficient hyperparameters. Among the effective methods of finding parameters, Grid Search is one of them.

Let's use the SVM (classification) model on the Social Network Ads dataset to find a good model for the above data using Grid Search.
